# Hi, I'm Max.

Student. Mathematician. Programmer. Engineer.

Main things I'm working on right now (as of 2024-10-05):

- Adding [guard patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3637) to Rust.
- Revamping [my personal site](https://maxniederman.com).
- Designing and building my own custom ergonomic split keyboard, inspired by the [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard).
- Looking for an internship. Feel free to [reach out](mailto://max@maxniederman.com)!

Besides my own projects, I also contribute to

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), my favorite programming language.
- [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org), my package manager, build tool, and operating system of choice.
- [Vexide](https://github.com/vexide/vexide), a Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots.

I was programming lead of [FRC Team 3636](https://frcteam3636.com) for two years.
