# Hi, I'm Max.

I’m Max, an eighteen-year-old software engineer. This is my GitHub, where (almost) all of my code lives.

I am currently searching for my next job and working on some independent projects. Previously, I was Chief Scientific Officer at [Bindwell](https://bindwell.com) (YC W25), and studied math at [Reed College](https://reed.edu).

Besides my own projects, I also contribute to FOSS projects like

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), my favorite programming language;
- [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org), my package manager, build tool, and operating system of choice; and
- [Vexide](https://github.com/vexide/vexide), a Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots.

I was also programming lead of [FRC Team 3636](https://frcteam3636.com) for two years.

I’ve pledged to donate at least 10% of my lifetime income to effective charities. [You should too.](https://givingwhatwecan.org/pledge)
