# Hi, I'm Max.

I'm currently working as a Chief Scientific Officer at [Bindwell](https://bindwell.ai) (YC W25).

Besides that, I'm also working on the following side projects (as of 2025-01-30):

- Adding [guard patterns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3637) to Rust.
- Adding the [armv7a-vex-v5 target](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131530) to Rust.
- Making [Centipede](https://github.com/max-niederman/centipede), a multipathing VPN for improving Internet reliability and performance.

Besides my own projects, I also contribute to

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), my favorite programming language.
- [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org), my package manager, build tool, and operating system of choice.
- [Vexide](https://github.com/vexide/vexide), a Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots.

I was programming lead of [FRC Team 3636](https://frcteam3636.com) for two years.
