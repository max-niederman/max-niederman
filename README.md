# Hi, I'm Max.

Student. Mathematician. Programmer. Engineer.

Main things I'm working on right now (as of 2024-04-25):

- Learning real analysis and abstract algebra.
- [Centipede](https://github.com/max-niederman/centipede), a high-performance multipathing VPN.
- Building a [field-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control_(motor)) motor controller (hardware and software) from scratch
- Revamping [my personal site](https://maxniederman.com).

Besides my own projects, I also contribute to

- [Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS](https://nixos.org), my package manager, build tool, and operating system of choice.
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), my favorite programming language.
- [Vexide](https://github.com/vexide/vexide), a Rust runtime for VEX V5 robots.
